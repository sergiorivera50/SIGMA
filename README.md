# SIGMA: Synthetic Image Generation Modeling API

SIGMA is a microservice automation framework that provides the infrastructure for easy consumption of pretrained synthetic image generation models. With SIGMA, developers can easily integrate image generation tools into their applications without having to train their own networks.

## Synthetic Image Generation Modeling 

Synthetic Image Generation Modeling is a technique used in computer vision to create large quantities of synthetic images that are similar to real ones but are generated by computer algorithms rather than captured by cameras. Generations can be useful in many applications where real images are scarce or difficult to obtain, such as in training machine learning models or testing computer vision algorithms.

## What does SIGMA do?

SIGMA provides a microservice infrastructure that serves pretrained Generative Adversarial models. SIGMA takes care of scaling and distributing the requests to the appropriate backends, which then use the pretrained GAN models to generate the requested images. The project is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for engineers who want to incorporate synthetic images into their projects without having to train their own GANs or setup their backend infrastructure.
