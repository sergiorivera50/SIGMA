# SIGMA: Synthetic Image Generation Modeling API

SIGMA is a microservice automation framework that provides infrastructure tools for easy consumption of pretrained Generative Adversarial Networks with the purposes of synthetic image generation. With SIGMA, developers can easily integrate scalable model consumption into their applications without having to train their own networks.

## Synthetic Image Generation Modeling 

Synthetic Image Generation Modeling is a technique used in computer vision and machine learning to create large quantities of synthetic images that are similar to real ones but are generated by computer algorithms rather than captured by cameras. Synthetic images can be useful in many applications where real images are scarce or difficult to obtain, such as in training machine learning models or testing computer vision algorithms.

## What does SIGMA do?

SIGMA provides a microservice infrastructure that serves pretrained GAN models for synthetic image generation. SIGMA takes care of scaling and distributing the requests to the appropriate microservices, which then use the pretrained GAN models to generate the requested images. SIGMA is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to incorporate synthetic images into their projects without having to train their own GAN models or setup their backend infrastructure.
